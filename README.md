# BeanBook
===========

### Description

This will be a web app project where users can create accounts, log in, track what coffee drinks they have consumed, and then see a summary with charts/graphs of their consumption.

### How it works

The plan is to slowly roll out features, but ultimately end up with the PERN stack. At first it will be getting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript set up. Then get the backend and database set up. And finally it will be getting everything connected and deployed.

### Technologies

- PostgreSql
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js
- Bootstrap

This project will be under the MIT license.
